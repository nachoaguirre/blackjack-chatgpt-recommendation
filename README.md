# Blackjack ChatGPT Recommendation

## Introduction

Small project that uses the OpenAI API to obtain a recommendation on whether it is advisable to ask for a new card or stay. This is done by sending the player's current card point count and a list of the cards that are in the deck.

This is a simple example of how to use the OpenAI API to obtain recommendations based on a certaing context and conditions. The game is a simple blackjack game that was obtained from a Udemy course. The game is not the main focus of this project, but it is a good example of how to use the OpenAI API to obtain recommendations for a game.
